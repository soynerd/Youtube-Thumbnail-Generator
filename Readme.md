## About The Project

ThumbForge AI was built to solve a common problem for content creators: the time and creative energy it takes to design an engaging YouTube thumbnail. This application streamlines the entire process. Users can input a simple idea, upload reference images, and use a step-by-step wizard to guide the AI.

The backend uses an intelligent agent powered by OpenAI's GPT-4.1 to refine and expand user prompts, which are then fed to Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate six distinct visual options. The entire application is protected by a secure, session-based authentication system.

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Secure User Authentication**: Full sign-up, sign-in, and logout functionality using Lucia Auth.
- üîê **Protected Routes**: The core generator UI is only accessible to authenticated users.
- üß† **AI-Powered Prompt Enhancement**: Uses GPT-4.1 to intelligently rewrite and detail user prompts for better image results.
- üñºÔ∏è **Multi-Model Image Generation**: Leverages Google Gemini to produce six high-quality thumbnail options from a single prompt.
- ü™Ñ **Multi-Step Generation Wizard**: Guides users through selecting a domain (e.g., Tech, Education) and style (e.g., Realistic, Ghibli) to refine results.
- üí° **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Provides users with suggestions (e.g., "Add bold text," "Use vibrant colors") to further improve their prompts.
- üìÇ **Reference Image Uploads**: Users can upload up to four images to guide the AI's generation.
- üîÑ **Iterative Creation Flow**: "Reuse" a generated image as a new reference, allowing for continuous refinement.
- üëÅÔ∏è **Image Management**: Includes in-app image preview, selection, and download functionality.
- üåì **Dark/Light Mode**: Themed interface using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.17 or newer recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (or npm/yarn)
- A [Neon](https://neon.tech/) account for the database.
- API keys for [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/soynerd/Youtube-Thumbnail-Generator.git
    cd Youtube-Thumbnail-Generator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials.

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below for details on what to add.

4.  **Push the database schema:**
    This command will sync your Prisma schema with your Neon database, creating the `User` and `Session` tables.

    ```sh
    npx prisma db push
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    pnpm dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Project Structure

The project uses the Next.js App Router. Here is a brief overview of the key directories:

- **/app**: Contains all routes, pages, and layouts.
  - **/app/api**: Houses all backend API routes (e.g., for authentication and image generation).
  - **/app/actions**: Contains all Next.js Server Actions (e.g., `logout`).
- **/components**: Contains all shared React components, including the main UI and `shadcn/ui` components.
- **/lib**: Contains utility functions, authentication logic (`auth.ts`, `session.ts`), and database helpers.
- **/prisma**: Contains the `schema.prisma` file, which defines the database schema.

---

## Future Work

This project has a solid foundation, but there are many potential features to add:

- [ ] **OAuth Integration**: Add "Sign in with Google" functionality.
- [ ] **Credit System**: Implement a credit-based system for API usage.
- [ ] **User Gallery**: Allow users to view and manage their previously generated images.
- [ ] **In-App Editor**: Add a simple editor to add text or overlays to generated images.
- [ ] **More AI Models**: Integrate with other image generation models like Stable Diffusion or DALL-E 3.
